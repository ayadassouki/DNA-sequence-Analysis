# DNA-sequence-Analysis
A Python-based toolkit for analyzing DNA sequences. Features include calculating GC content, identifying open reading frames (ORFs), and detecting common motifs. Designed to assist in bioinformatics and genomic sequence analysis.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing DNA sequences to calculate GC content, identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and detect common motifs. These analyses are crucial for understanding the genetic information carried by DNA and have applications in genetics, bioinformatics, and medical research.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install biopython numpy matplotlib
```

## Features

 ### GC Content Calculation: 
 Calculates the percentage of guanine (G) or cytosine (C) in a DNA sequence, which is indicative of the sequence's stability.

### Identification of Open Reading Frames (ORFs):
Identifies potential protein-coding regions in a DNA sequence, starting with a start codon and ending with a stop codon.

### Detection of Common Motifs: 
Searches for known motifs within the sequence, which can have significant biological implications.
